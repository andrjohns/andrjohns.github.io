I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in Bayesian Statistics & Probabilistic AI at Aalto University in Helsinki. My current research focus is on knowledge translation and improving the accessibility of Bayesian statistical methods for applied and clinical researchers. My background and previous experience is primarily in Psychology, and I maintain an active research interest in the clinical presentations of Parkinson's disease, as well as the treatment and management of social anxiety disorder.

## Software

### Bayesian Statistics: Stan

I've been part of the development team for [Stan](https://about.mc-stan.org) since 2017. Stan is currently one of the most popular platforms for Bayesian statistical analysis, and is used in a very wide of contexts: from Nobel prize-winning research in gravitational waves, to the modelling of COVID-19 progression at the height of the pandemic.

I primarily work in our C++ auto-differentiation library, adding and optimising new statistical distributions and functions:

  - [Stan Math](https://github.com/stan-dev/math/)

I'm also one of the primary developers for our R interfaces:

 - [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/)
 - [cmdstanr](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr)

### Healthcare Monitoring & Visualisation

I'm also the primary developer and maintainer for two custom visuals for PowerBI (Microsoft's dashboard and analytics product), written in Typescript:

 - [PowerBI-SPC](https://aus-doh-safety-and-quality.github.io/PowerBI-SPC/)
 - [PowerBI-Funnels](https://aus-doh-safety-and-quality.github.io/PowerBI-Funnels/)

These visuals are used for Statistical Process Control, a graphical means of assessing whether changes over time or differences between groups are large enough to be considered statistically meaningful. These visuals are commonly applied for healthcare monitoring and are used to help identify whether the outcomes at a given healthcare site differ from other sites, or whether there has been a change in outcomes over time. The visuals were developed in active collaboration between the West Australian Department of Health and the NHS, and are seeing increasing use in organisations throughout Australia and internationally.
